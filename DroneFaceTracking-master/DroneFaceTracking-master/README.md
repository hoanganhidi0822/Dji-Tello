# DroneFaceTracking
Computer Vision - face tracking with DJI Tello mini drone

It works :D ..., cv2 face detection still has some issues in its accuracy.
I will try to use YOLO instead in the next revison. 

drone forward and backward movments are not yet implemented (be careful with those indoors)


You will need following libraries:

- djitellopy
- opencv-python
- numpy

(all available from pip)
